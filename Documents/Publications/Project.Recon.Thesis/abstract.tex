Abstact
Motion and gesture input systems are spreading in software development during the past few years. Some examples are Microsoft's Kinect, Nintendo's Wii, or Sony's Move.
This spread ranged to affect video games and fitness programs. However, none of the fitness programs focus on actual contact sports techniques.
In this project, we will use Microsoft Kinect to create an application that will help Ju-Jutsu (a martial arts form) practitioners to keep track of their performance.
