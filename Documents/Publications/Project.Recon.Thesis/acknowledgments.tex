This project would not have been possible without the help of people that showed endless support, care, and patience with me. I would like to thank my supervisor, Assoc. Prof. Georg Jung, for his continuous understanding, motivation, and patience. I would also like to thank him for his guidance and care through out the whole process to make sure that I am gaining from the research and work and that I am on the right track. I would like to express my deepest appreciation and graditude to my supervisor for all that he has provided from his knowledge and hard work that in the end provided me to complete this thesis.

I would also like to thank my colleagues Hassan Aly Selim and Amr Osman for their support in helping me understand XNA ,Kinect SDK, and Socket Programing. Without their support to me this project wouldn't have been possible.

I would also like to thank my parents, brother and sister for their support, care, and love that helped me through out the project and the thesis.
