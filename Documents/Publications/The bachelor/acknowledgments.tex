This project would not have been possible without my supervisor, professor Georg Jung's continuous support and encouragement. I am also very grateful to my family because of the support they gave to me from the beginning of the project till the very end.\\

I would like to give a special thank you to my grandmother, who has motivated me to work when I needed it the most.\\

Lastly, I would like to thank my friends Omar Mowafi, Fady Kamal, Nada Nasr, Mai Nasser, Amr Tharwat, Tarek Samy and many others for giving me feedback about my work when I needed it, as well as supporting me the whole time.
