IMPACT is a multidisciplinary project in which students of computer science (more precisely: software engineering), material sciences, mechatronics and embedded system design come together to create Thai-boxing pads with builtin impact sensors and wireless connection to a base station.
In this project, we will implement a multi-sensor tracking and analysis tool for a physical workout routine specific to Thai/kick-boxing or similar contact sports to track and display performance and fitness level of a practitioner over a single and over multiple sessions. It will be used to record and correlate the inputs from impact sensors and technique recognition and track improvemets of practitioners over time.
