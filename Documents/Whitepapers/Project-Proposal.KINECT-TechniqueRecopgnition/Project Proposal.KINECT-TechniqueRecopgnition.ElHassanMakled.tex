Motion and gesture input systems are spreading in software development during the past few years. Some examples could be Microsoft's Kinect, Nintendo's Wii, or Sony's Move. 
The spread of this application ranged to affect video games and fitness programs. However, none of the fitness programs focused on actual contact sports techniques. 
In this project, we will use Microsoft Kinect to create an application that will take a group of JiuJutsu (a form of martial arts) moves as an input during a practice session, 
and compares them to a library of moves that are used as reference to calculate the delta. 
The project will also focus on measuring the impact of certain striking moves in different 
methods either by sound or by a sensor equiped Thai-pad depending on the situation of the practice session being captured.  

\subsection*{Tasks}
\begin{itemize}
\item Creating the libarary for the moves to be used as a reference.
\item Measuring and calculating the delta between the two moves, reference and captured move or previous user moves.
\end{itemize}
