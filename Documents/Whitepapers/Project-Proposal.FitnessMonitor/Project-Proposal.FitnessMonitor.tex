\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  \textsc{Impact} is a multidisciplinary project in which students
  of computer science (more precisely: software engineering), material
  sciences, mechatronics and embedded system design come together to
  create Thai-boxing pads with builtin impact sensors and wireless
  connection to a base station.

  In this project, we will implement a multi-sensor tracking and
  analysis tool for a physical workout routine specific to
  Thai/kick-boxing or similar contact sports to track and display
  performance and fitness level of a practitioner over a single and
  over multiple sessions. It will be used to record and correlate the
  inputs from impact sensors and technique recognition and track
  improvemets of practitioners over time.
