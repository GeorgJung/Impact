Scenario (Done with Makled):
1. The sensor connects to a free socket.
2. Sends a signal to the interface (HandShake begin).
3. The interface replies with a "OK" signal (HandShake end).
4. The sensor begins sending the actual data.
5. The interface receives the data through the sockets and sends it to the interpreter.
6. The interpreter translates the data to actuall numbers and info and sends it to the monitor (to display the data received) and the database manager (to save the data).
7. The database manager sends the data + the history to the statistics engine.
8. The statistics engine generates the analysis and sends it to the monitor.
9. At last, the monitor displays everything.
