% Structuring a talk is a difficult task and the following structure
% may not be suitable. Here are some rules that apply for this
% solution: 

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

% - A conference audience is likely to know very little of what you
%   are going to talk about. So *simplify*!
% - In a 20min talk, getting the main ideas across is hard
%   enough. Leave out details, even if it means being less precise than
%   you think necessary.
% - If you omit details that are vital to the proof/implementation,
%   just say so once. Everybody will be happy with that.

\section{Recognition Techniques}
\subsection{Glyphs Method}
%Normal Vector
%problem with kinect
%draw the path that each joint takes and store it in an image

%joints create path shadowing past movements
%each joint has its own exclusive color
%as the user moves glyphs are created
%image of user and glyph
%image of glyph
\begin{frame}{The Challenges in Kinect}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item The user always faces the Kinect
  \item Kinect does not differentiate between facing and not facing
  \item Solution:
   \begin{itemize}
    \item Normalize the skeleton of the user (Always ends up facing)
   \end{itemize}
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Normal Vector}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Create normal between vectors $\vec{r}$, $\vec{c}$, and $\vec{l}$
 \end{itemize}
 \pause
 \centering{$\vec{N}$ = ($\vec{r}$ - $\vec{c}$) $\times$ ($\vec{l}$ - $\vec{c}$)}
 \end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Glyphs Method}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Rotates the skeleton of the user
  \item Draws the path joints take and  stores it in an image
  \item Each joint will have its own exclusive color
 \end{itemize}
 \centering{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{glyphfinal.png}}
\end{frame}
\subsection{Joint Positions Lists}
\begin{frame}{Joint Positions Lists}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Creates a list (n=30)
  \item The list stores object types StoreGesture (Position, Time Stamp)
 \end{itemize}
 \centering{\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{stack.png}}
\end{frame}
\subsection{MCS UK}
\begin{frame}{MCS UK}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Microsoft Consultant Services UK
 \item Gesture service for Kinect for Windows
 \item The gesture service is written in C$^\sharp$
 \item Similar to the JPL in a manner.
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Architecture}

\begin{frame}{Architecture}
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{gesturestate.png}}
\end{frame}
\section{Communication}
\subsection{Communication to the Interface}
\begin{frame}{Communication to the Interface}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Connection is attempted once Kinect is plugged and ready
 \item The interface listens for gestures
 \item User sends gestures with their timestamps
 \item Once connection to the interface falls, program terminates
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\subsection{Demonstration}
\begin{frame}{Demonstration}

\section*{Summary}

\begin{frame}{Summary}
  % Keep the summary *very short*.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \alert{Real time recognition} was accomplished by Kinect's fast streaming.
  \item
    The \alert{Robust and Dynamic} requirement was not fully possible was Kinect has a lot of limitations.
  \item
    \alert{Plugging in to the interface}, was possible through Socket programming.
  \end{itemize}
  
  % The following outlook is optional.
  \vskip0pt plus.5fill
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Outlook
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Differentiation between facing and not facing(Solved in the new Kinect).
    \item
      Detecting minor movements.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% All of the following is optional and typically not needed.
